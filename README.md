# The Giphy Slack Command for Groupme

This is a bot that adds the functionality of the `/giphy` command from Slack to Groupme.

After deployment, users can just message a group on Groupme a text saying `/giphy [something]` and the bot will respond with the first gif it finds on Giphy by searching the query `something`.
